			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I grow up on the PS2 that my dad had. I played madden with him all the time, then when I was old enough to figure out there was more games then just madden, I started playing games like Rachet and Clank. Which to this dad is still one of my all time favorite games. I also played games like Tony Hawk, the Spider Man games, and me and my mom played the Pac-Man games. Then my PS2 broke when I got a Jimmy Neutron game. So my dad went out and got me a new PS2 (the slim) I was beond happy. Here I thought I'd never get to play all my favorite games again and he surprises me with that. I also played my dads PSP, and later bought my own PS3. I then found Assassins Creed, and instiny fell in love with the game, I have bought every one since then. Then for 2014's Christmas I got the PS4, and now play games like Assassin;s Creed, Just Cause 3, GTA 5, Guitar Hero Live, and Wolfenstein The New Order. But my main gaming is on PC, I get most of my games on PC beacause the contoller just doesnt do it for me. Most of the single player and FPS' I get on PC. It all started with Garry's Mod and TF2 and progressed to playing CS:GO and Rust on PC, but I also have all the Batman Arkhan games on PC, Mad Max, Fallout 4, both Metro games, The Witcher 3, and all of the Hitman games. Just to put it into perpective I have 25 installed games but 151 games all together.
